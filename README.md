# Challenge 6: Weather Dashboard

## Description: A weather dashboard that uses OpenWeather API and ReverseGeocoding API
    * The ReversGeocoding API determines the users location to present the current weather and five day forecast of the that location
    * The Open Weather API was used to determine the longitude and latitude of the user requested cities in order to provide them with the current weather and five day forecast of the requested city
    * Past searches are stored in localStorage and presented as buttons on the screen for users to push. This allows them to go between a past and current search.
    * User may have as many storage spots as localStorage will allow, but in order to clear the saved locations, localStorage must be emptyied.

## Tools Used:
    * Bootstrap
    * JQuery
    * Local Storage
    * Moment.js

## Future updates:
    * Make seach queries more specific with added parameters such as country and state
    * Make it easy to delete singular searches instead of the entire thing
    * Provide home button to return to current location based weather conditions
